## About Me
I'm Ali, a PhD student in Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University. I'm passionate about software engineering, large language models, system security, and malware detection. 

I have experience building custom software solutions using Python, Django, Django REST Framework, Java, C, C++, and other technologies. As a freelance developer, I've worked on projects for various clients, developing and deploying REST APIs, web applications, and more.

Previously, I interned as a Django developer at Pishro Net Energy, where I gained valuable experience in full-stack development. I sharpened my skills in Django, Python REST APIs, Docker, GitLab CI/CD, and other relevant technologies. 

I love learning and staying updated on the latest trends in computer engineering. In my free time, you can find me reading books, mountaineering, or listening to music while coding.

I'm always eager to take on new challenges and opportunities to build innovative solutions. Feel free to connect with me to collaborate or just chat!
